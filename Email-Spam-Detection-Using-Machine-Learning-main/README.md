# Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for building a simple email spam detection system using Naive Bayes classifier in Python.

## Introduction

Email spam detection is a classic problem in machine learning where the goal is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). Naive Bayes classifier is a popular algorithm for this task due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Spambase Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a collection of emails labeled as spam or non-spam, along with various features extracted from these emails.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:
- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Email-Spam-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Email-Spam-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
   ```

3. Run the `spam_detection.py` script:
   ```
   python spam_detection.py
   ```

This script loads the Spambase dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluates its performance using cross-validation.

## Results

The performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are printed to the console after running the `spam_detection.py` script.
